This post is the first in a new blog post series under the cheeky label of _You could have invented it!_. The aim of this series is to present a cohesive, first-principles to final derivation presentation of a theoretical gem, spanning the range from mathematics, computer science, or physics. The target audience is a reasonably keen graduate possessing a first degree in one of these three fields with a passing familiarity with either of the other two fields.

Each post in the YCHII series will optimistically include each of the following components:
```
TODO:
+ blog post series: start from problem setting (as a given); progress to derivation
+ from first principles to end
+ with code & simulation in python
```

For this inaugural post, we will present a quick discussion of a curio in the annals of gambling, known as the __Kelly Criterion__. Despite its mathematical simplicity, it is fairly counter-intuitive and thus was only discovered in the mid-twentieth century.
