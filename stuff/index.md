Things I'm Working On
=====================

Check out my [github page](https://github.com/paultsw).

Writing
-------
I have a blog with friendly explanations of algorithms, data structures, and basics of machine learning. You can find it here: [Algoland!](https://algorithm.land). Excuse the sparseness --- it's a permanent work-in-progress.

I also have a substack blog focused on structural analyses of political economy, social organization, history, and technology. I'm currently growing the audience base anonymously, but I will update this page with a link to the website once I de-anonymize.

I'm working on polishing up some long-form notes on various deeper topics in mathematics and computer science. Watch this space!
